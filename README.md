# CS-230-Final-Project

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client. They wanted to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe one thing I did well on this document was comparing the different types of operating systems needed to complete the game. I was able to understand each OS more deeply and was able to recognize some pros and cons of each.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think the UML diagram from the document, in particular, have helped me a lot in developing the code for the various classes for the game.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the recommendation section of the document as I feel I need more information regarding the security of the various OSs.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I viewed the user’s need as requirements and then implemented them as constraints into the game design.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In this project, I mostly referred to the course reading, and the available resources offered by it. One particular technique or strategy I found helpful and will utilize in the future is design patterns.
